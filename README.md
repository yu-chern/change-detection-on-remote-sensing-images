# change-detection-on-remote-sensing-images
This is a national college-student innovation project funded by Northwestern Polytechnical University(NWPU) with 20,000 RMB.  

In this project, we invented a more general Histogram Fuzzy C-means Clustering algorithm to improve the quality of change detection on remote sensing images.  

This repository presents the results of change detection analysis we obtained in both a report and slides (written in Chinese Only). To obtain the Matlab code of the project, please contact [Yu Chen](chernyu@outlook.com).
